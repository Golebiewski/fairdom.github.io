title: NFDI4Health - German National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data 

NFDI4Health - the German National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data - deals with data generated in clinical trials, epidemiological and public health studies. The collection and analysis of these data on health and disease status and important factors influencing it are an essential component for the development of new therapies, comprehensive care approaches and preventive measures in a modern health care system. Although these data already meet high content quality standards, they often do not fulfil the requirements of the FAIR principles:

- The findability of data is often limited due to the lack of international standards for registration and publication.
- Possibilities for data use by third parties are usually unclear.
- Databases are often not interoperable, e.g. due to the great methodological heterogeneity in the recording of exposures and health endpoints.
- Furthermore, privacy requirements and informed consent of study participants restrict the reuse of data.

MISSION
The mission of NFDI4Health is to provide new opportunities for the scientific use of personal health data while respecting privacy requirements. Based on the FAIR principles, services are provided to researchers to permanently store, semantically enrich and share data in interoperable form and to merge data from different sources.

OBJECTIVES
The NFDI intents to systematically make the databases of science and research accessible, secure them in the long term, and network them (inter)nationally. Embedded in this overarching framework, the aims of NFDI4Health are to:
1) Enable findability of and access to structured health data.
2) Obtain federal framework for data holding organizations.
3) Facilitate exchange and record linkage of personal health data in compliance with privacy regulations and ethical requirements.
4) Establish automated services (e.g. search, analysis tools).
5) Foster interoperability and reusability of data.
6) Enhance use case-oriented collaboration among research communities.

NFDI4Health will increase the visibility and accessibility of research data, enhance the reputation of scientists who share their data, and foster new collaborations.

FAIRDOM IN NFDI4HEALTH
As one of 18 partners in the long-term initiative funded by both the German Federal Government and German state governments, HITS will bring its many years of expertise with scientific databases and its experience in data standardization to the table. The SEEK platform will play a central role as a “hub” for data bundling, especially for metadata from various studies that are collected and sorted in NFDI4Health. The SEEK software will be adapted to meet these requirements . Together with project partner ZB Med in Cologne, the HITS researchers will also develop a search portal that will access these data in order to make it easier for users to find them.

ABOUT NFDI4HEALTH
The initiative consists of an interdisciplinary team of 18 partners. A total of 46 renowned institutions from the health sector have confirmed their participation, including major professional associations and epidemiological cohorts. Letters of support have been received from 37 national and international institutions.
In support of the establishment and promotion of all research data infrastructures, both the German Federal Government and individual states together intend to provide up to EUR 90 million annually until 2028, with the intention to create a long-term sustained platform supporting research.
