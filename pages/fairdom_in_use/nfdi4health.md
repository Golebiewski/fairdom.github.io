## Introduction

The objective of NFDI4Health (https://www.nfdi4health.de/en/) is the amalgamation of data and metadata from epidemiological, public health and clinical research studies. Therefore, it will develop a research data infrastructure for personal health data.

The overarching goal of NFDI4Health is to support its clinical and epidemiological research community in the best possible way to share their data with the user community in agreement with data protection/privacy regulations and ethics principles and, in the interest of improving population health, create new data analytics opportunities within the German NFDI.

To reach these goals in accordance with the FAIR data principles, the key objectives of NFDI4Health are
(1) to enable findability of and access to structured health data from clinical trials, epidemiological studies, disease registries, administrative health databases and public health surveillance in Germany;
(2) to implement a health data framework for centralised searching and accessing existing decentralised epidemiological/clinical trial data infrastructures;
(3) to facilitate data sharing, record linkage, harmonised data quality assessments, federated analyses of personal health data;
(4) to enable the development and deployment of new, machine-processable consent mechanisms and innovative data access services;
(5) to support cooperation between clinical trial research, epidemiological and public health communities;
(6) to foster interoperability of currently fragmented IT solutions related to metadata repositories, cohort browsing, data quality and harmonisation.


## NFDI4Health uses FAIRDOM SEEK for its Local Data Hubs

The LDH is the local node in the federated concept of NFDI4Health (https://www.nfdi4health.de/en/service/local-data-hub.html). 

From the search in the German Central Health Study Hub (https://csh.nfdi4health.de) or via own web pages, users can access study data and corresponding metadata via local research data management platforms - the Local Data Hubs (LDHs). In an LDH instance detailed supplementary study resources such as study protocols, data sets, references to publications, repositories, registers, analysis platforms are networked and presented in context. The LDH software is based on FAIRDOM SEEK and is being further developed by the NFDI4Health partners at the Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology (IMISE) of the Leipzig University and HITS gGmbH in Heidelberg. By this SEEK is optimised together with the international community via the target communities of NFDI4Health to meet the needs of clinical trials, epidemiological cohorts and public health studies.
